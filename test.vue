Hi Team,

After extensive discussions around requirements and system design, I’m pleased to share that we’ve officially commenced development on the project as of today.

Project Overview:
[Insert a brief 1–2 line description of the project and its objective here, if applicable.]

To ensure we stay aligned throughout the development cycle, I will be scheduling weekly demo sessions. These will be held on our local environments to showcase progress, gather feedback, and make necessary adjustments early on.

Once we receive access to the target environment, we will migrate our work accordingly and continue with integration and testing phases.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions in the meantime.
